# Installation

Put these files in your TEX search path. Ideally you should use the directory `TEXMFHOME` points to (use `echo ${TEXMFHOME}` to show that directory). You can put the files in a subdirectory if you like. **Caution:** If you use a different directory of the TEX search path you might need to run `mktexlsr` (possibly as superuser) to make your TEX distribution find the new files.
